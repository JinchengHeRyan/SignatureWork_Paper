    \emph{150 -- 200 words}. \emph{An abstract is a brief statement of the
    problem or the purpose of the research. It should indicate the
    theoretical work or experimental plan used, summarize principal findings
    of the research, and point out major conclusions. Appropriate safety
    information should be included when applicable. This should be the
    section you write last to be sure that it accurately reflects the

    \emph{Individuals and organizations who helped with the research project
    and provided financing are thanked in a paragraph of the thesis. Do not
    include individual titles in the acknowledgments. However, it is
    appropriate to state grant numbers and sponsors. Examples would like
    SELF, SRS, SW Grants, etc.}

    \emph{This section includes a clear statement of the problem and the
    reasons for studying it.~Provide a detailed yet concise background
    discussion of the problem and the significance, scope, and limits of the
    work. Outline what has been done previously by citing truly pertinent
    literature but do not include a general survey of semi-relevant
    literature.~ State how your work differs from earlier work in the field
    and demonstrate the continuity from the previous work to your own.}

    \hypertarget{material-and-methods}{%


        \section{MATERIAL AND METHODS}\label{material-and-methods}}

    \emph{This section is obviously discipline specific so use the
    nomenclature that is common for your discipline. However, this section
    should provide sufficient detail about the materials and the methods
    used so that other experienced workers can repeat the experiment and
    obtain comparable results. Cite the appropriate literature when using a
    standard method or protocol and give only the details needed. Identify
    the materials used in the research. For example, computer systems used,
        mathematical theorems exploited, etc.; give information on the purity of
        all chemicals and reagents employed in the research; include the
        chemical/biological names of all compounds and chemical formulas of
        substances that are new or uncommon. Use standard systematic
        nomenclature to unambiguously define well-established compounds,
        processes, equipment, etc.}

    \hypertarget{results}{%


        \section{RESULTS}\label{results}}

    \emph{Summarize the data collected in this section, and their
    statistical treatment. Include only relevant data, but give sufficient
    detail to justify the conclusions.~ It is appropriate in this section to
    use equations, figures, and tables to display your data. Extensive, but
    relevant data, should be reserved for an appendix where it is identified
    as supporting information.}

    \emph{The table or figure must follow as closely as possible after the
    paragraph in which it is referenced. Titles/captions should be kept
    brief.}

    \emph{The discussion section is where you interpret and compare the

    the work. Relate your results to current knowledge in the field and to
    the original purpose for undertaking the project.}
